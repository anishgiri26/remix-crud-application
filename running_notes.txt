To initialise a SQLite database in prisma
npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite

Then you need push this database
npx prisma db push

You then need to create a seed.js file with the inital data and then run it 
node prisma/seed.js

You can right click on dev.db and open in SQLite. Run the query to see what th table looks like.
