What does Outlet in Remix do? 
In Remix, an Outlet is a special component that serves as a placeholder for the content of a route. It is used to define where the content for a particular route should be rendered within the layout of the application.
When a user navigates to a new route, the Outlet component is replaced with the content for that route. This allows for dynamic content to be rendered based on the user's navigation.
For example, consider a blog website built using Remix. The website might have a layout component that includes a navigation bar, header, and footer. Within the layout component, there might be an Outlet component that serves as a placeholder for the content of each individual blog post.
When a user navigates to a specific blog post, the Outlet component is replaced with the content for that post, while the navigation bar, header, and footer remain the same.
Overall, the Outlet component is a key feature of Remix that allows for dynamic rendering of content within a layout.
